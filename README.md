This website is developed by using Node.js and javascript for backend and bootstrap, html and javascript for frontend.
In this I have used MongoDB for storing campgrounds. Normally I'm handeling all CRUD method i.e for C for Creating campground and storing into DB,
R for Reading from database and displaying on user screen, U for Updating database for any specific campground and D for Deleting database elements.

I've also provided login option so that a user can login and then they can comment on any campgrounds.

Displaying full details of a specific campgrounds and also displaying comments so that any specific user can comment on that or delete that comment.
